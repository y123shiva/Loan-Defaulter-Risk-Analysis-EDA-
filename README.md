# Loan-Defaulter-Risk-Analysis-EDA-

# Introduction

This case study aims to give us an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that we have learnt in the EDA module, we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers

# The aim of this project is to answer the following questions:

1. What would be your first step? List different EDA you would like to do with the data before you get started.

2. How are you going to handle missing values? Ideate and list them.

3. Before getting into modeling, apart from points a. and b., do you want to do anything else with the data to understand default behavior?

4. The default labeling is based on customers who did not pay 3 installments continuously. Do you want to rethink about this labelling strategy for the target? How will    you validate the labelling strategy is correct?

5. How are you going to handle outliers, numerical columns and categorical columns

6. Do you want to include the entire 1000 features?
